Air Quality Dataset
📦 Contents
- Features: PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃, humidity, temperature, wind speed.
- Labels: Air quality index (AQI) category as regression target and health class as classification target.
- Format: Structured tabular data, possibly time-series for trend analysis.
🛠️ Done:
- Imbalanced Data Handling: Used resampling or weighted loss functions to address skewed AQI categories.
- Validation & Error Handling: Built robust input checks and fallback logic for missing sensor data.
- Modeling: Likely regression or multi-class classification with interpretability (e.g., SHAP, feature importance).



Water Quality Dataset
📦 Contents
- Features: pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature, and possibly location/time metadata.
- Labels: Water safety classification (e.g., safe/unsafe, or multi-class levels of contamination).
- Format: Likely CSV or JSON, optimized for model input and deployment.
🛠️ Done:
- Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values, normalized ranges, and validated input formats.
- Feature Engineering: Created derived metrics (e.g., pollution index, seasonal indicators).
- Modeling: Applied classification models with cross-validation and interpretability tools.
- Deployment: Compressed model files, added fallback messaging, and integrated predictions into a Flask app with advice blocks.
- UI/UX: Designed visual feedback (emoji buttons, alert boxes) to make predictions understandable and trustworthy.
